	<strong> Name: </strong>  Kathryn E. Lee
	<br>

	<strong> Nickname: </strong> Katkat
	<br>

	<strong> About myself: </strong>A 22 year-old Computer Science student from Bicol. I spend my "free" time watching movies or TV series recommended by my friends. I also like to read about new things from the Internet. I rarely go out of the apartment except when I go to class or when some friends of mine invite me to dinner or to chill out (haha). 
	<br>

	<strong> Real reason for taking ComSci </strong> I took ComSci as my course because I thought it was fun back in high scool. But I realized now that it was very far compared to what is being taught here.
	<br>

	<strong> Favorite comsci so far: </strong>  CMSC 150. It is very challenging and the computations are very helpful in training muscle memory.  
	<br>

	<strong> Favorite programming language: </strong> Java PL! There's so much to learn in Java. :)
	<br>

	<strong> Hobbies: </strong> Browsing through online stores but not buying anything! :D
	<br>

	<strong> Favorite food/s: </strong> Fried chicken, cake, ice cream, lasagna.
	<br>

	<strong> Favorite color: </strong> Green
